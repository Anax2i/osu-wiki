## Ruleset

### General

1. The 3 Digit World Cup is a **country-based**, **3 versus 3**, **double-elimination** team tournament, played on the **osu!** game mode.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on **ScoreV2**.
3. The minimum size for a team is **3 players**, and the maximum is **6**.
4. The rank range is **#100–999**. Players outside the rank range are allowed to register. However, if they are not strictly within the rank range by the time registrations close (January 12, 18:00 UTC), their registration will be removed.
   - After registrations close, players are allowed to leave the rank range.
5. Teams will be seeded by Qualifier results.
6. Grand Finals will feature a **bracket reset** if the team coming from the losers' bracket wins the first match.
7. Match schedules and other events will be displayed in **UTC time**.
8. The tournament organisers reserve the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.

### Conduct

1. All spaces affiliated with 3WC are subject to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules), as well as the rules of the respective platforms themselves.
2. Players are expected to uphold a competitive and friendly environment, and to treat tournament staff and other players with respect.
   - This includes keeping matches running smoothly and avoiding deliberate delays.
3. Any foul play, including but not limited to cheating, bracket manipulation, and failure to cooperate in match rescheduling, is strictly prohibited.
4. Failing to abide by these rules will be punished accordingly and **may lead to the offending player or team being disqualified**.

### Registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually by connecting their osu! and Discord accounts via the [registration page](https://r.shdewz.me/3wc25-registration).
   - The tournament organisers will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - The tournament organisers will elect one representative for each country with at least 3 players registered as the provisional captain for that team.
   - The provisional captain will receive a private message via Discord containing further instructions for submitting the final team.
2. Countries that fail to have enough registrations for the minimum team size may merge with other nearby, closely related countries, at the tournament organisers discretion.
3. The provisional captain will then form their team by selecting players from the candidate pool for their country during the team submission phase.
   - Captains are expected to choose team members with honesty and good will, with the aim of fielding the strongest team possible.
   - Captains are allowed to exclude themselves from the team list.
   - Captains are allowed and encouraged to conduct and coordinate "tryouts", tests to gauge player aptitude, on their own terms.
   - Captains are allowed, at any time, to transfer their role to other prospective team members. Once given, only the new captain may assign the captaincy to another player.
   - Users responsible for organising their country's tryouts are encouraged to contact ::{ flag=NL }:: [nik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077264) or ::{ flag=FI }:: [shdewz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10000899) in advance to be elected as provisional captains for their team.
   - Captains are allowed to include up to 2 substitute players in their team submission. These substitute players may replace any players that get screened out.
   - **Teams that do not not send their team list by January 26, 23:59 UTC will be disqualified from the tournament.**
4. After the team submission phase, all selected players will be checked by the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) through [screening](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#tournament-screening).
   - Players must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months to pass the screening.
5. Tournament staff members are **not** allowed to play in the tournament, with the exception of commentators and streamers.

### Mappool information

1. Every stage will have its own mappool.
2. Each mappool will consist of 5 brackets: [No Mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#no-mod), [Hidden](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hidden), [Hard Rock](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock), [Double Time](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Double_Time), and [Free Mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#free-mod).

### Match instructions

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room before the scheduled match time and the captains of both teams will be invited. The captains are then responsible for inviting the rest of their team. If the captain of a team is not online, the referee will invite any other player from the team, who is then responsible for substituting their captain.
2. Teams have a **strict 10-minute grace period** to have **at least 4 players** available to play the match. If 10 minutes pass and a team cannot field enough players to play the match, the other team will receive a win by default unless a reschedule is agreed upon by both teams within a timely manner.
3. At the start of the match, both captains will `!roll`. The **roll winner will choose either the pick or the ban order**, with the **loser choosing the remaining order**.
4. There will be no warmup maps.
5. The referee is not allowed to play in the match.
6. Each team may ban **one beatmap** from the mappool in the Round of 16 and Quarterfinals, increased to **two beatmaps** from Semifinals onwards. Banned maps beatmaps are effectively removed from the mappool and cannot be picked for the entire duration of the match.
   - From Semifinals onwards, bans will follow a **snaking (ABBA) order**.
7. After bans are decided, both teams will take turns in picking a beatmap from the mappool.
8. There are no pick or ban restrictions, that is, players are allowed to pick or ban multiple beatmaps from the same mod bracket in a row.
9. Teams will have **one 2-minute timeout available per match**. Timeouts can be activated at any time at the team's discretion.
10. Teams are allowed **2 minutes to pick a beatmap** and **2 minutes to ready up** after a pick. If a team takes more time than allotted for either action, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
    - For the first occurence:
      - The team will receive a verbal warning from the referee and their tactical timeout will be forcefully used to allow for the team to pick or ready up.
      - If the timeout ends and the team is still not ready, it will be counted as a subsequent occurence.
    - On subsequent occurences or if a timeout is not available:
      - For a pick timer: the map pick will pass to the other team.
      - For a ready timer: the referee will force start the match with `!mp start 15` and the map will start with the players present in the lobby.
        - Should a team have too many players in the lobby, the scores from their 3 worst-performing players will be counted.
      - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the tournament organisers.
11. If a player disconnects during play, common sense will be applied: if proof exists of the disconnected player's score (or a rough estimate of their hypothetical score if they finished the map), it will be added to their team's total score; if it is at all ambiguous, the other team will get the point.
    - If a disconnection happens in the **first 30 seconds or 1/4 of the map's drain time** (whichever comes first) the team may ask to replay the map. This will be allowed once per match and suspected misuse may lead to disqualification.
    - Any replays of a map must be done with the same rosters as the initial playthrough. If the disconnected player is unable to play due to the nature of the disconnect, both teams will be able to change rosters.

### Qualifier instructions

1. The Qualifier mappool will feature 10 beatmaps, organised as such:
   - No Mod: 4 beatmaps
   - Hidden: 2 beatmaps
   - Hard Rock: 2 beatmaps
   - Double Time: 2 beatmaps
2. Teams have until **Friday, February 7, 23:59 UTC**, to choose a time to play qualifiers. Teams that fail to select a time before the deadline will be disqualified.
   - The latest time to play qualifiers is **Sunday, February 9, 20:00 UTC**.
3. Teams will play through the **entire** mappool **in the order** given on the mappool sheet up to **two times**.
   - Teams are allowed to skip maps on their second playthrough.
   - The **best team score on each map** is used for seeding.
4. Each team must have 3 players play each map. Players may be exchanged freely between maps.
5. All teams will play their qualifiers in separate rooms. It is *suggested* that teams do not broadcast or share their results publicly to avoid seed manipulation.
   - Multiple teams may be grouped into a singular room if there are not enough referees available at match time.
6. Qualifiers will be seeded by cumulative z-score, scaled to 0–100.
   - The exact formula that will be used for all teams (and for each map) is `z-score = (Team score - Mean score) / Standard deviation`, where:
     - `Team score` is the score the current team achieved on the current map
     - `Mean score` is the mean score across all teams on the current map
     - `Standard deviation` is the standard deviation of all team scores on the current map
   - The final score for each team is `Points = SUM(z-score)`, which is then visually scaled to 0–100 with `Final Points = 100 * (Points - MIN(Points)) / (MAX(Points) - MIN(Points))`, where:
     - `MIN(Points)` is the points of the lowest ranking team
     - `MAX(Points)` is the points of the highest ranking team
7. The **16 best-performing** teams will advance to the Round of 16.
